# Daily Ozoner Analysis 🌫️

This project analyzes air quality (ozone) levels in the United States using data from the EPA Air Quality System from 2020 to 2021.

## 📊 Key Questions Addressed
- Which state had the highest 1st Max AQI value?
- What is the average AQI by state?
- How do event types affect AQI levels?
- What is the relationship between observation count and arithmetic mean?

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for interactive geospatial visuals)
- CSV data from EPA AQS

## 📊 Project Goals

We aimed to answer the following key questions using data analysis and visualizations:

### Q1: Which state had the highest **1st Max Value** of AQI?
- **Tools**: Bar Graphs, Aggregation, Filtering  
- **Insight**: Arizona and California consistently had the highest max ozone values.

### Q2: What is the average AQI by state?
- **Tools**: Boxplots, Table Calculations, Geospatial Mapping  
- **Insight**: Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada topped the list in quarterly average AQI.

### Q3: What’s the relationship between **Observation Count** and **Arithmetic Mean**?
- **Tools**: Scatter Plot, Geospatial Map, Trendlines  
- **Insight**: Positive correlation between the number of observations and AQI averages.

### Q4: How does **Event Type** affect AQI?
- **Tools**: Bubble Charts, Pie Charts, Map Visuals  
- **Insight**: Events during June and August notably increased AQI in specific regions.
